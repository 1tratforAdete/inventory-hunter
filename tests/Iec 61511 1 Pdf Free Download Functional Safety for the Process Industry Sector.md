Users can also organize color trend information into color palettes for creating color concepts. Designs can be imported into spreadsheets for creating spec sheets. A special colorway menu allows quick evaluation of various color combinations using realistic knit and weave textures. It also features a licensed Pantone color database for accurate color communication.
 
## Pattern Program
 
The Pattern program is used to create various patterns such as check, dobby and double weave. Users can select from an abundant database of patterns or create their own by combining and editing data. Using the Automatic Pattern Repeat function, both normal and stepped repeats can be performed with controlled precision. Realistically woven images can be simulated as well.
 
## Embroidery Program
 
The Embroidery program features automatic punching, a pattern stitch database and special embroidery pen. Users can create realistic simulations of embroideries with various effects such as shading, gradation, etc. Users can also adjust the density, direction and size of stitches.
 
## PGM Program
 
The PGM program is a full-featured apparel CAD system that allows users to create and fine-tune patterns for all apparel applications. Patternmaking is especially important for quality shaping and WHOLEGARMENT knitting. With SDS-ONE's patternmaking software, high-quality patterns can be created easily. Comprehensive drawing and editing functions allow detailed control approaching that of manual patternmaking.
 
Correct sizing of products can be achieved with grading software. Users can choose between pitch-formula and rule-formula grading. With such high-quality grading features as line-check and automatic pitch calculation, optimum grading pitch can be worked out for each product size.
 
In addition to manual marking, SDS-ONE's marking software features ultra-high speed automatic marking for instant creation of markers. The software is also capable of creating markers in sequence, allowing fully automated marking of multiple jobs overnight.
 
## KnitCAD Program
 
The KnitCAD program features automatic programming based on conversion of patterns to number of loops. SDS-ONE also supports fashioning frequency input. Structure patterns can be selected from an abundant database for visual confirmation on-screen. Knitting data is automatically created simultaneously.
