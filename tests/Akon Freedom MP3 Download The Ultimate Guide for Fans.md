The album was originally named Acquitted, but Akon changed it before it was released to reflect his personal and artistic freedom. He said: "The reason I chose Freedom for the title of my album is because I have reached a point in my career where I don't have to answer to anybody. And it feels good to say that I am free to do whatever I want."[^3^]
 
The album received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Akon's production skills and collaborations with other artists, but criticized his lyrics and lack of originality. The album debuted at number seven on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 110,000 copies in its first week. It also charted in several other countries, such as Canada, France, Germany and the UK. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for selling over one million copies in the US.
