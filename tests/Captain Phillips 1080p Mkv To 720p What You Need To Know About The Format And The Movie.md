## Why Convert Captain Phillips 1080p MKV to 720p MP4?
 
You may wonder why you need to convert Captain Phillips 1080p MKV to 720p MP4 in the first place. After all, MKV is a popular video container format that can store multiple audio and video streams, subtitles, and metadata. Moreover, 1080p is a high-definition resolution that can deliver crisp and clear images. So why bother converting the file to a different format and resolution?
 
Well, there are several reasons why you may want to convert Captain Phillips 1080p MKV to 720p MP4. Here are some of them:

- **Compatibility:** Not all devices and platforms can play MKV files natively. For example, iOS devices, such as iPhone and iPad, do not support MKV playback without third-party apps. MP4, on the other hand, is a widely supported video format that can play on almost any device and platform. By converting the MKV file to MP4, you can ensure that you can watch Captain Phillips on your preferred device without any hassle.
- **File size:** MKV files tend to be larger than MP4 files due to the multiple streams and metadata they contain. For example, a 2-hour Captain Phillips 1080p MKV file may take up more than 4 GB of storage space. This can be a problem if you have limited storage space on your device or if you want to transfer the file online. By converting the MKV file to a lower resolution, such as 720p, you can reduce the file size significantly. For example, a 2-hour Captain Phillips 720p MP4 file may take up only 1 GB of storage space. This can save you a lot of storage space and bandwidth.
- **Quality:** You may think that converting the MKV file to a lower resolution will compromise the quality of the video. However, this is not necessarily true. Depending on the quality level you choose, you may not notice much difference in the video quality between 1080p and 720p. Moreover, some devices have screens that cannot display 1080p resolution anyway. For example, most smartphones have screens that are smaller than 5 inches and have resolutions lower than 1080p. By converting the MKV file to 720p, you can still enjoy watching Captain Phillips in high quality without wasting unnecessary pixels.

As you can see, there are many benefits of converting Captain Phillips 1080p MKV to 720p MP4. You can improve the compatibility, reduce the file size, and maintain the quality of the video by using a reliable online tool like HDConvert.com. Try it out today and see for yourself how easy and convenient it is to convert Captain Phillips 1080p MKV to 720p MP4.
