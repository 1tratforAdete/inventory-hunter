However, you should also be aware that this book is not a substitute for a teacher or a class. The book is meant to be a supplement and a support for your learning, but it cannot replace the guidance and feedback that a teacher can provide. The book is also not a guarantee for exam success. The book can help you practice and improve your skills, but it cannot ensure that you will pass any exam. The book is also not a complete course. The book is focused on testing and revision, but it does not cover all the aspects and skills of the English language.
 
Therefore, if you want to make the most of this book, you should use it in combination with other resources and methods. For example, you should use the book along with the course book and the workbook of the **English File Pre-Intermediate** series. You should also use the book with the study link that provides audio and video resources that complement the book. You should also use the book with a teacher or a tutor who can help you with any doubts or difficulties that you might have. You should also use the book with other sources of English input and output, such as books, magazines, websites, podcasts, movies, songs, games, etc.
 
In summary, **New English File Pre-Intermediate Test Book 56** is a valuable and comprehensive test book that can help you improve your English skills and prepare you for various exams. However, it is not a perfect or sufficient resource for your learning. You should use it wisely and creatively, and always seek for more opportunities to learn and practice English.
