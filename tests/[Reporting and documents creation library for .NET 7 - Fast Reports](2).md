## Report Objects
 
FastReport is a band-oriented report generator, which means that you can design your report layout using different types of bands, such as Report Title, Report Summary, Page Header, Page Footer, Data Header, Data Footer, Group Header, Group Footer, and more. Each band can contain various report objects, such as text, picture, line, shape, barcode, matrix, table, checkbox, etc.
 
Some of the report objects that FastReport 4.13 offers are:
 
- **Table object:** This object allows you to create a tabular report with variable number of rows and/or columns, just like in MS Excel. You can also use aggregate functions to calculate totals, averages, counts, etc.
- **Matrix object:** This object allows you to create a pivot table that can summarize and analyze data from different perspectives. You can drag and drop fields to change the layout of the matrix dynamically.
- **Sub-report object:** This object allows you to embed another report within your main report. This is useful for creating reports with common elements such as titles, logos, or footers.
- **PolyLine and Polygon objects:** These objects allow you to draw custom shapes using multiple points. You can also fill them with colors or gradients.
