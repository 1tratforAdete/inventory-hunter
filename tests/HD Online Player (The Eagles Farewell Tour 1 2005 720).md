The film also offers a glimpse into the history and legacy of the Eagles, one of the most successful and influential rock bands of all time. The Eagles formed in Los Angeles in 1971, when Linda Ronstadt and her manager John Boylan recruited local musicians Glenn Frey and Don Henley for her band[^1^]. They soon decided to form their own group, along with Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner, and signed with David Geffen's new Asylum Records label. Their debut album, Eagles (1972), spawned two top-20 singles in the US and Canada: \"Take It Easy\" and \"Witchy Woman\"[^1^].

The Eagles cultivated country rock as the reigning style and sensibility of white youth in the United States during the 1970s[^2^]. They blended rock, country, folk, and pop elements with tight harmonies and catchy melodies. They also reflected the shifting zeitgeist of the '70s, from the laid-back optimism of the early years to the disillusionment and decadence of the later ones[^3^]. They had five number-one singles and six number-one albums, six Grammy Awards and five American Music Awards, and sold more than 150 million records worldwide[^1^]. They also influenced countless artists across genres, from country to rock to pop.
 
The Eagles broke up in 1980 due to personal and creative differences, but reunited in 1994 for the album Hell Freezes Over, a mix of live and new studio tracks. They toured consistently until 2016, when Frey died of complications from rheumatoid arthritis, acute ulcerative colitis, and pneumonia[^1^]. The band continued with Frey's son Deacon and country star Vince Gill joining Henley, Walsh, and Schmit. The Eagles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998[^2^].
