## What is SainSmart DDS140 PC-Based Oscilloscope?
 
SainSmart DDS140 PC-Based Oscilloscope is a device that can measure and display electrical signals on your computer screen. It can capture waveforms of up to 40MHz bandwidth and 200MSa/s sampling rate. It can also generate signals of various shapes, frequencies and amplitudes by using the signal generator module. Moreover, it can analyze digital signals of up to 16 channels by using the logic analyzer module.
 
The SainSmart DDS140 PC-Based Oscilloscope consists of a main body and three optional sub-modules: the signal generator module, the logic analyzer module and the oscilloscope probe. The main body has two BNC ports for connecting the oscilloscope probe or the signal generator module, and a USB port for connecting to your computer. The main body also has a small metal tip that outputs a square wave signal of 1KHz and 3.3V peak-to-peak for testing purposes.
