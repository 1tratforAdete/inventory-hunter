## What is a Dongle?
 
A dongle is a small device that plugs into a computer's USB port or parallel port and acts as a hardware key or license for a software application. Dongles are used to prevent software piracy or unauthorized use of software by verifying the presence of the device. Dongles can also store some data or perform some functions related to the software.
 
## What is a Dongle Emulator?
 
A dongle emulator is a software tool that can create a virtual dongle or a fake hardware key for a software application. A dongle emulator can be used to bypass the dongle protection or to backup the dongle in case of loss or damage. A dongle emulator can also allow multiple users to access the same software without sharing the physical device.
