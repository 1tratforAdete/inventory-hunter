Fabfilter Pro MB is a multiband compressor and expander plug-in that offers a powerful and intuitive way to shape the dynamics of your audio tracks. Whether you want to transparently control the levels of different frequency ranges, add punch and clarity to your drums, or create subtle or extreme effects with upward or downward compression, Fabfilter Pro MB can handle it all.
 
Unlike conventional multiband processors that split the entire spectrum with crossovers, Fabfilter Pro MB lets you create up to six bands at any frequency range you want to work on. You can easily snap bands together to form a traditional crossover system, or adjust the steepness of each crossover slope from 6 dB/oct to 48 dB/oct. The interactive multiband display shows you exactly what's going on and how the rest of the spectrum stays untouched.

One of the unique features of Fabfilter Pro MB is its Dynamic Phase processing mode, which has virtually the same frequency response as traditional multiband processing, but doesn't introduce latency or pre-ringing, and only introduces minor phase changes when the gain actually changes[^1^] [^3^] [^4^]. This makes it ideal for mastering and other situations where phase coherence is critical. Of course, Fabfilter Pro MB also offers an excellent Linear Phase mode and a traditional Minimum Phase mode, as well as up to four times linear-phase oversampling for even higher quality.
 
Fabfilter Pro MB gives you full control over every aspect of your dynamics processing, with customizable per band parameters such as threshold, range, attack, release, output gain, ratio, variable knee, lookahead, variable stereo linking, mid- or side-only processing, external side chain input, and triggering on a separate frequency range. You can also use intelligent program- and frequency-dependent attack and release curves that adapt to the incoming signal for natural sounding results.
 
With its beautiful Retina interface, optimized workflow, and expert features, Fabfilter Pro MB is a must-have tool for anyone who works with audio. Whether you need a simple two-band compressor or a complex multiband expander with external side chaining, Fabfilter Pro MB can do it all with ease and elegance. You can try it for free for 30 days from their official website[^1^] or buy it from Plugin Boutique[^3^] with a 14-day money back guarantee.
  
## How to Use Fabfilter Pro MB
 
Using Fabfilter Pro MB is easy and intuitive, thanks to its interactive multiband display and flexible band controls. You can insert Fabfilter Pro MB on any audio track, instrument track or bus in your DAW, and start creating bands by clicking and dragging on the display. You can also double-click on an existing band to edit its parameters, or right-click on a band to access more options such as soloing, bypassing, copying or deleting.
 
Each band has its own dynamics processing section, where you can adjust the threshold, range, attack, release, output gain and ratio. You can also choose between different compression styles, such as clean, classic or opto. You can also switch between compression and expansion modes by clicking on the arrows next to the ratio knob. You can also enable a variable knee for smoother transitions, or a lookahead function for more accurate peak detection.
 
One of the most powerful features of Fabfilter Pro MB is its sidechain functionality. You can use an external sidechain input to trigger the dynamics processing of any band, or use an internal sidechain filter to fine-tune the frequency range that affects the processing. You can also use a separate frequency range for triggering and processing, which allows you to create dynamic EQ effects or de-essing. To access the sidechain options, click on the Expert button next to each band.
