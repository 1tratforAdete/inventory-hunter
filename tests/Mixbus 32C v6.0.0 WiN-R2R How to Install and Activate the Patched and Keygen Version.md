Mixbus 32C is a digital audio workstation (DAW) that combines the features and workflow of a modern DAW with the sound and feel of a classic analog console.

Mixbus 32C also includes a comprehensive set of plugins, MIDI editing, automation, and more.

Mixbus 32C uses a proprietary DSP engine that mimics the analog circuitry of the Harrison 32C console, including its summing, saturation, crosstalk, and noise characteristics. The result is a warm, rich, and musical sound that can enhance any genre or style of music. Many users have reported that their mixes sound better and more cohesive with Mixbus 32C, even without using any plugins or effects.
 
Speaking of plugins and effects, Mixbus 32C comes with a generous bundle of high-quality plugins that cover all the basic needs of mixing and mastering. You get compressors, limiters, EQs, reverbs, delays, modulation effects, distortion, tape emulation, and more. All the plugins are compatible with VST2, VST3, AU, and LV2 formats, and can be used in other DAWs as well. Mixbus 32C also supports third-party plugins from other developers, so you can expand your sonic palette as much as you want.
