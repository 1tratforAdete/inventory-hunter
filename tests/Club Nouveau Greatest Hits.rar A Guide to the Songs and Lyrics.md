## Lean on Me
 
Lean on Me is arguably Club Nouveau's most famous song, and one of the most successful covers of all time. The song was originally written and recorded by Bill Withers in 1972, and it became a classic soul anthem about friendship and support. Club Nouveau's version added a contemporary twist to the song, with synthesizers, drum machines, and rap vocals. The result was a catchy and upbeat rendition that appealed to a wider audience and earned them a Grammy Award for Best R&B Song in 1987.
 
Lean on Me is a song that can uplift your mood and inspire you to help others. The lyrics are simple but powerful, conveying a message of solidarity and compassion. The chorus goes: "Lean on me, when you're not strong / And I'll be your friend / I'll help you carry on / For it won't be long / 'Til I'm gonna need / Somebody to lean on". The song reminds us that we all need someone to lean on sometimes, and that we should be there for each other in times of need.
 
## Jealousy
 
Jealousy is another hit song by Club Nouveau, which was released as their debut single in 1986. The song is about the negative effects of jealousy on a relationship, and how it can lead to mistrust and resentment. The song features a catchy hook that repeats the word "jealousy" over and over, creating a sense of tension and frustration. The verses describe how jealousy can make someone act irrationally and unfairly towards their partner, accusing them of cheating or lying without any proof.
 
Jealousy is a song that can resonate with anyone who has experienced or witnessed jealousy in a relationship. The song warns us about the dangers of letting jealousy take over our emotions and actions, and how it can ruin a good thing. The song also encourages us to communicate with our partner and trust them, instead of letting our insecurities get the best of us.
